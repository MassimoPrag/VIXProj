- ✅ **Real Returns Analysis**: New section analyzing asset performance adjusted for both CPI and P=MV/Q inflation
- ✅ **Monetary Data Pipeline**: Integrated FRED API for real economic data (CPI, M2, GDP, Velocity)
- ✅ **P=MV/Q Calculation**: Implemented quantity theory of money price level calculation
- ✅ **Multi-Asset Analysis**: Support for major indices (SPY, QQQ, VOO), Bitcoin, Gold, and individual stocks

### 3. Technical Implementation
- ✅ **Data Handler**: Robust data fetching from FRED and Yahoo Finance with caching
- ✅ **Real Returns Analyzer**: Modular class for calculating inflation-adjusted returns
- ✅ **Interactive Dashboard**: Streamlit app with multiple pages and visualizations
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and synthetic data generation
- ✅ **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test suite for all components
